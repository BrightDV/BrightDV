### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am available to translate open-source apps to french (from english only).
**If you want a translation, [open an issue in this repo and I will answer ASAP](https://github.com/BrightDV/Contact).**

**Don't worry, it's free ;)**


Here are some ideas to get me started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some translations
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning.exe
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with stackoverflow
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: star all my repositories
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: maybe ?? null
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like readmes

Et voila ;)
