### Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get me started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some translations
- 🌱 I’m currently learning.exe
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with stackoverflow
- 📫 How to reach me: star all my repositories, watch them & fork them. Then, buy Google and spam my mail with a link to your Twitter account which redirects to your GitHub account. You will have 1 over a lot of chances to get an answer 👍
- 😄 Pronouns: maybe ?? null
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like readmes

Et voila ;)
