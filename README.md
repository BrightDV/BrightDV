### Hi there 👋

### I am available to translate open-source apps to french (from english only).
**If you want a translation, open an issue in my repo and I will answer ASAP.**

**Don't worry, it's free ;)**


Here are some ideas to get me started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on some translations
- 🌱 I’m currently learning.exe
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with stackoverflow
- 📫 How to reach me: star all my repositories
- 😄 Pronouns: maybe ?? null
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like readmes

And voilà ;)
