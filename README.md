### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**BrightDV/BrightDV** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on my GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get me started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some cool stuff and translations
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter & Java
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with stackoverflow
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about me
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: star all my repositories
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Bright
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like pasta
